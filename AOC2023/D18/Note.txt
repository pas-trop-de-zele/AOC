READ THE QUESTION FIRST, then all the highlights, then backtrack

TEND TO FORGET:
    remmeber to int(c) the ones that require numbers
    strip().split()
    split('\n\n') tend to follow by another fin[1].split("\n")
    before doing case work can you just brute every combination

GRID PROBLEMS:
    watch out row vs col issue
    watch out if input given is (y, x) OR (x, y)
    watch out if starting point is (0,0) or something else
    y+1 is under, y-1 is above

TECHNIQUES:
    lamdba old, ops : eval(ops)
    use try/ except when needing to read int / string instead of having to nested if else
    set() & set()
    startwith endwith
    tuple() do not ''.join()
